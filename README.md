# Summary

The script intended to accomplish all the objetives of the project:

1.- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2.- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3.- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4.- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

5.- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# How to use run_analisys.R

The script can be used as is, you only need to change the path of the directory with the files.
I made this script with a linux-pc, so the names of the files is uppercase or lowercase sensitive.
